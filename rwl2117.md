# Project Proposal

## Consigliere
This project aims to provide on-request advice from a number of sources: books, articles, websites, etc. It aggregates and presents relevant writing based on the user's query.

Link to project: https://github.com/Ray725/consigliere

## Example
### User:

disagree

### Consigliere:

**Don’t make judgments**

When you move on to expressing your concerns, watch your language carefully. Grenny says to avoid any “judgment words” such as “short-sighted,” “foolish,” or “hasty” that might set off your counterpart; one of his tips is to cut out all adjectives, since “they have the potential to be misinterpreted or taken personally.” Share only facts.

## Features
This app will be hosted as a Telegram bot to enable interactivity and availability. The user can define which books, article sources, and websites they wish the bot to search through.

The main focus of initial development will be interfacing with books.
