Project Idea: Website written in Python that takes user music listening data and presents it with compelling visuals in collaboration with Lord Crawford (lrc2161).

We will be taking information from Spotify and other music platform's APIs, and using it to create tables and graphs to easily comprehend data
that would otherwise not be accessible. Examples include most listened to artists and songs within different time frames. 

Another aspect of this website would be to include a visualizer that has different settings and could be played in conjuction to the users
favorite songs and artists. 

Using the data and visualizer, we also want to create a short video that will be easily shareable in social media platforms. 

Extra: We also want to see if it would be possible to integrate music recommendation algorithms to create personalized suggestions/playlists.
Ideally, we also want to generate playlists based on other users' listening habits (computer generated "friend recommendations"), if this is 
not possible we want to create playlists based on specified artist/genres tailored to the user's listening habits (very useful if you want to 
start listening to a certain genre or artist).
