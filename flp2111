I have a large background in mobile app development, espically iOS, and I would like to focus on a iOS open source project.

Project Ideas

1. Creating any type of calendar in an app is a long process. The only API they have is a scroller so for years developers either tried to build their own calendar or try open source projects (most are out dated or barely kept up). In iOS 14 they're giving developers a proper calendar but the UI and interaction is less than ideal.

2. Creating an easy tutorial open source project. Creating a tutorial in a app is long and complciated process to get the animations correct and adapt to many different screen sizes. This idea would make it easy and fully customizable to make tutorials.

3. Enhance the experience of including Apple's Siri development. I've read that many developers are worried about the complexity of siri development. I would like to make a project that eases the process of incorporating Siri into any app. Would need to look more into this though to evaluate the complexity.
