Project Proposal: Website that takes user music listening data and presents it with compelling visuals & data analytics in collaboration with Vittorio Luzio (vl2419).

We will be using the Spotify API and possibly expanding to other platforms (Soundcloud, Deezer). With this information, our website will provide users their most listened to songs and artists coupled with music visualizations of specific songs. We hope to also incorporate interesting data metrics for each song/artist and within the visualizations include things like BPM, noted lyrics, etc.
 
A huge benefit that we want to provide to users is being able to have a summary of their most listened to music â€“ it will be in the form of a short video highlighting most played music with interesting visualizations and stats. Users can share this video (approximately 10 second left) on their social medias or simply view it.

This project would be built using Python (Flask), Javascript, and HTML/CSS primarily (open to other suggestions though) and would rely heavily on a mobile integration.

Extra Project/Feature: We want to explore creating auto-generated playlists based on a user's friend music activity; we're not sure if it is possible to access a friend's music activity though. If not, we still think creating auto-generated playlists based off a user's song library would be an interesting feature to develop.
