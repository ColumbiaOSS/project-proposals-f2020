Creo is an open source VC deal and lead management platform built with Flask.

## Background and Motivation

Earlier this semester, a few friends and I started a pre-seed VC fund. We were on the market searching for a VC deal and source management platform and soon realized that there is no inexpensive option out there. Additionally, I find it important to store all our data in-house for compliance purposes. Therefore, I started to create this open source deal management platform that can extend easily to include more features.

## Project

The project is a Flask-based information log and view system. I used Flask-WTF and wtform to render forms and extensive SQL queries to add new, modify and list all logs.
