## Background and Motivation

I use Flask a lot in agile website development. Whenever I try to create forms in HTML and use Flask as backend to process form data, I find many of my codes to be redundant. If I want to create three different forms, I can re-use most of my code but have to tweak each individual segment.

## Project

I will create a Python package Flask-Form to bring easy-to-create and easy-to-render forms to the Flask framework.
