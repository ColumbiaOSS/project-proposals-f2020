# Ideas
- Idea 1: interactive map of small POC-owned businesses
# Proposal:
- In light of recent protests and the increased participation in the Black Lives Matter Movement, we want to create an interactive map of small, black-owned and POC-owned businesses in New York City to allow users to easily find ways to shop small and support POC businesses near them.
