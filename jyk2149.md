# Project Idea
A marketplace/portfolio that automatically puts a rank and value on cumulative social media presence.

## Motivation
The idea of an "Ad Marketplace" has been a widly popular and successful idea for a while now. With companies like google and facebook using them to help companies run ad campaigns on the internet. However, with "influencer marketing" becoming more popular, the interaction between sponsor and sponsee is still being done manually through emails and connections. This consumes a lot of time and money from marketing teams who should be able to run these influencer campaigns in similar fashion to normal ad campaigns.

## Objective
This project has two purposes, each for both sides of a sponsorship
For the Sponsor:
    1. Create a "marketplace of influencers" so that companies can discover and run campaigns for their product/brand.

For the Sponsee/Influcener:
    1. Rank/Value your social media presence against other influencers to standardize your content/influence
    2. Connect with sponsors, and gain revenue more consistently based on your rank
