# Project Idea
Real-time Physical Ad Analysis

## Motivation
Digital ads inherently have performance tracking metrics (through pixels, ad marketplace data, etc) that help advertisment companies/teams guage whether or not their ads are converting into sales/lookups. However, these sort of metrics are lost in the space of physical ad spaces. Therefore, I want to create a way to use simple low cost cameras to gain data on physical ad spaces (gaze time, count, etc), to provide these metrics to advertisement companies.

## Objective
Create a tool that measures and gives analytics on how many times a person looks at an ad and how much time each person spends looking at an ad. (Without breaking PII).
