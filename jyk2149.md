# Project Idea
Group Decision Making App


## Motivation
Decision making is really hard, even for one person. It's even worse for a pair, group, or crowd. So, Let's Decide is a group decision app that allows for blame free, guilt free decision making on things like food, activities, movies, etc.

## Objective
Create a app that allows people to create and join a room using a code "Like Jackbox or Kahoot" that brings up the list of suggestions. Then, the app gets the highest ranking mutual ranking and spits out the decision.
