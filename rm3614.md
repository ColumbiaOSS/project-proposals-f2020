## Background
Something that I've been wanting to set time aside to work on for a long time is a comprehensive, extendable NodeJS wrapper for the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) library. PyTorch is a Python package that enables Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration, and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system.<br><br>
PyTorch has been catching up with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in terms of popularity ([ref](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-pytorch-catching-tensorflow-ca88f9128304)) over the last few years, and with features like dynamic computation graphs, the ability to use standard control-flow statements during training, PyTorch is closing the gap and becoming the framework of choice for a lot of people in the deep learning space. We're also seeing projects like [Tensorboard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html), initially a library for the Tensorflow ecosystem, becoming PyTorch compatible, and the PyTorch community has really grown over the last year or two.<br><br>
With the advent of NodeJS, and the rise in popularity of the JavaScript community in general, I've realised that unlike Tensorflow (ref: [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)), PyTorch lacks a JavaScript equivalent which would allow developers and data-scientists to deploy PyTorch models in NodeJS environments. This (usually) leads to most PyTorch model deployments occuring via Microservice-esque Flask/Django deployments, which isn't always the ideal solution (especially when it's just about deploying a single model and your codebase is relatively smaller than most large corporate codebases). I believe that developing a NodeJS binding for PyTorch would be an extremely interesting, and impactful project, because it would both allow Node developers to avoid the need to adopt a whole different language/framework (Python using Flask/Django, or even something like TorchServe) while attempting to deploy and host PyTorch trained models.<br>
## Prior Work
This is a library that I've personally been hoping would crop up for the longest time. As someone who's worked a fair amount with both training Deep Learning models as well as putting them into production over the last year, this is a problem I was always hoping would be addressed eventually. I found a few alternatives, but each has their own set of caveats and pifalls, that I would want to try and mitigate:

 - [torch-js](https://github.com/torch-js/torch-js): This is the closest example to what I envision this project potentially looking like. However, the functionality is limited (things as basic as PyTorch transforms aren't really supported) and the project seems more like a one-off. However, there is an active [fork](https://github.com/arition/torch-js) of this project by [arition](https://github.com/arition). I plan on [working on this fork](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/torch-js) in order to provide some underlying functionality for my library, because this would mean that we don't need to worry about running Torchscript in a JS environment.
 - [onnx.js](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs): onnx.js lets developers run models exported using the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) interface, in a JavaScript environment. ONNX is great, and is an amazing project, but suffers from the pitfalls that any common interface/protocol would face from, namely the lack of the ability to use those features that make a library like PyTorch distinct.
## A JS wrapper for PyTorch would be useful
I think that building a NodeJS wrapper for PyTorch, while maybe a tall ask, could be a beneficial project. Starting at just an execution runtime in NodeJS for example, may be a more feasible approach, allowing developers who have trained PyTorch models in Python to use a NodeJS runtime to put them into production. I think this could also open up a whole world of interesting possibilities, including calling PyTorch models during client-side executation as well, since JavaScript runs in many forms, on both the client side and the server side.<br><br>I think this would be the primary use case for such a library anyway, as we've seen with the community response to Tensorflow.js. JavaScript and NodeJS are great for writing web-servers, but not always to train Deep Learning models. However, deploying them in JS runtimes is something that I feel is worth working on.
