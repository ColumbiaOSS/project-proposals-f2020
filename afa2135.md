COMS4995 Project

I am thinking of making a chess Game.
Idea is for me to build the backend and the user can make their own UI to use my code with.
I will provide an example UI (terminal) to use the game with.


I started working on my chess game and I am working around with the issues colum on github. THis is a link to the repo:

This update has linting, testing, and code coverage steps as well as hosting w/ autodocs.
