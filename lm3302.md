Project proposal:
Linking government-provided mental health services for domestic violence/sexual assault survivors with a database of free or low-cost counseling services in each state. Due to coronavirus, services are being offered remotely and there are more slots.
- Type your state (high level), zip code(highest level)
    - get counseling services for sexual assault and domestic violence victims in your area
- Draft pre-written email for them to click and insert their own email to reach out to healthcare professionals
- Also make it trans and gender inclusive, addiction inclusive, low-income friendly
- Confidentiality (safe exit button)
- Accessibility (screen readers, etc)
- Built-in chatbot ability for scheduling and remembering appointments, maybe integrate with Twilio for appointment reminders
