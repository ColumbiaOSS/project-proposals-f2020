Project Proposal


I want to create a web application for my father's business/personal projects. He currently has two businesses: 

1. His private medical practice 
2. Maintenance of Well-Being: a business he recently started to give lifestyle/health counseling to individuals. The program is built around 10 mandatory sessions that participants must attend over the course of 6 months, and follow a yoga/meditation series through one-on-one sessions (conducted over Zoom) and by watching videos & responding to prompts to ensure participation and attendance. The main challenge here is to implement a progress tracker for participants, so I will be building a system where people can create profiles, customize them, schedule sessions, and keep track of their progress throughout the program. 

In addition, the overall website will have an option for users to subscribe and receive weekly newsletters that will touch on important health and lifestyle related content. 

I am thinking of building a Flask application for now, so I'll be using JavaScript, Python and HTML/CSS
