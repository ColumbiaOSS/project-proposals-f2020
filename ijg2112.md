### Motivation
I really like music and the arts but I'm not artistically gifted:( I'd like to try using my programming skills to make something cool related to music/art. 
Hopefully others will be able to take my work and add their own creative iterations.

### Idea 1
An iOS app using ARKit that allows users to see 3D AR music visualizers around them. Users can also make a group session with friends where they can listen and experience the same music and visual effects.

### Idea 2
Similar to idea 1 but a web application. The session would still be sharable with friends. 

### Features/Goals
1. Creating a server that connects and synchronizes music/visuals for users in an app session.
2. Various algorithms for audio-based visual effects.
3. UI that allows for uploading of audio files/ URLs, changing visuals, audio playback controls, and adding people to a session.
