# Project ideas:

1. A plug-in/extension which takes a recipe in a standard format (ingredients list/steps) and reformats it to make it more digestible/intuitive for following along (putting qtys in the steps as the ingredients are mentioned). Saw this idea online, but dont think it has been done.
2. Collab with another student on a fully customizable calendar that can be integrated into apps
