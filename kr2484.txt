Project ideas:

1. Saw this idea online, don't think anyone else has done it: A plug-in or something that reformats recipes from their standard format (ingredients/instructions) into a more digestible/intuitive format that makes it easier as you're following along (qtys incorporated into steps)

2.Collab with another student on a fully customizable calendar idea that can be integrated into apps
