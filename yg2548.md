# Project Proposal


## Background and Motivation
There is a hole in deserealization/validation libraries for Python. There exist [libraries](https://json-schema.org/) that allow you to deserealize data but often involve coming up with tedious schemas to define it. Deserealization should also be extensible. You don't want to be restricted to only JSON or YMAL.

## volga

**volga is a framework for *de*serealizing Python data structures**

- Source code [https://github.com/yefrig/volga](https://github.com/yefrig/volga)

volga will allow you to *flow* your data into any format that you'd like.

```python3
  import volga-json
  
  @Deserealize
  def class User():
    name: Annotated<str, volga-json.exclude('yefri')>
    age: int
  
  
  # ...
  
  deserealized = volga-json.from_string(json_string)
```

## Future Enhancements

Given the nature of the volga framework, anyone can implement any data format and be automatically supported by the library. Also, if your data structures are too complex for the generated (de)serealization protocols, you can always implement your own to define exactly how you want your data to flow.
