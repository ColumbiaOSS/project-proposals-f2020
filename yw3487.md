Update: I released [v0.1](https://github.com/wRosie/notebook_magiclight), and added demo to README

Update: I renamed my project. The new link is https://github.com/wRosie/notebook_magiclight
The docs badge is in README of my project.

Update: adding build and codecov badges.\
They are created with dummy tests for the purpose of assignment to work through the travis/codecov workflow.\
I haven't yet found a good way to test with Jupyter frontend extensions. The testing frameworks for jupyterlab seems doesn't work for Jupyter notebook.

# COME4995

This is a course project for Open Source Development

# Ideas
1. A software to resize laptop webpage to mobile phone ones when opening webpages on the phone. The main feature is to reorganize the webpage, so that it will be easier to read on a mobile phone. (It might be implemented through browser extensions, but Chrome doesn't support extensions on Android or ios. A Firefox add-on might do the job).
2. A Jupyter Notebook extension to do syntax highlight for SQL code. A lot of people are using SQL plug-ins to run SQL statments in Jupyter notebook, but I didn't find anything to do some syntax highlight for the SQL code.
