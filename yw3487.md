This is a course project for Open Source Development

# Ideas
1. A software to resize laptop webpage to mobile phone ones when opening webpages on the phone. The main feature is to reorganize the webpage, so that it will be easier to read on a mobile phone. (It might be implemented through browser extensions, but Chrome doesn't support extensions on Android or ios. A Firefox add-on might do the job).
2. A Jupyter Notebook extension to do syntax highlight for SQL code. A lot of people are using SQL plug-ins to run SQL statments in Jupyter notebook, but I didn't find anything to do some syntax highlight for the SQL code.
