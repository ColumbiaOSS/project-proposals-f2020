### Background
Music producers use a technique called "sampling" to reuse elements of other audio tracks (songs, sounds, acapellas, recordings, etc.) in their own tracks. Almost all hits these days are produced with sampling. One of the most recognizable uses of sampling can be heard in the 2011 JAY-Z / Kanye West hit ["Otis"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU), where Kanye produced the song by sampling Otis Redding's 1966 song ["Try A Little Tenderness"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojnDaqaEg3E). You can check out the site [Who Sampled](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/107060/Jay-Z-Kanye-West-Otis-Redding-Otis-Otis-Redding-Try-a-Little-Tenderness/) to explore how this was done with Otis, as well as hundreds of other songs.

### Project
Currently, sampling is primarily done through digital audio workstations (DAWs) — take a look at Ableton's [Simpler](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/simpler-and-sampler-pro-tips-and-techniques-slynk/) or Logic Pro X's [Sampler](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211115). Both DAWs cost hundreds of dollars, and I have yet to find an easy-to-use, versatile sampling tool online. There is definitely a need for an open-sourced online sampling tool that replicates the basic functionality of these professional DAWs for producers to use.

### Tech Stack
Thinking of JavaScript and a single-page web app.
