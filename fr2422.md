## Background:
Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges on the ethereum platform use liquidity pools to replace traditional orderbooks found in traditional equities exchanges. This allows anyone to provide liquidity to any erc20 token pair and act as a market makers. Currently the largest decentralized exchanges, such as uniswap.org, have billions of dollars worth of liquidity available.

## Project:
Create a detailed analytics tool that will provide consistent statistics, measure performance, and track the flow of liquidity throught all decentralized exchanges on the ethereum chain. The tenative plan is to create a backend that will analyze the ethereum chain and provide the data from an API, and create a frontend to present that data.
