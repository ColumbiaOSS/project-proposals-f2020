# Project Proposal 

- a web app using spotify's Web API that visualizes the user's musical preferences by providing analysis into rhythm/beats + genre of their liked songs
- maybe also implement multiple filters based on beats/rhythm, genre, artist as well as a combination of these filters for song discovery
- a tinder-esqe app for music; based on your current liked songs playlists, it queues up a list of related songs that you can swipe right or left on 
	- swiping right would add it to your liked songs and update your preferences 
	- swiping left means you are not interested; this may or may not also affect preferences 
- a 'listening room' where multiple people can add songs; people may vote for specific songs, and the most voted song is played. Would be cool if there is also functionality to add the song to your own liked songs playlist. 


Generally, looking into any projects that have unique applications of the spotify API.
