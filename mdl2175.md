# Project Ideas
An application that aggregates messages from all your messaging apps (facebook messenger, slack, discord, gitter, groupme, google hangouts etc.)

## Motivation
As technology has made communication more and more accessible, so too has the number of communication methods. Nowadays, it isn't surprising to have multiple forms of preferred communication, whether that be through facebook messnger, slack, discord, gitter, groupme etc. Without any standardized communication application, I have personally found it frustrating to keep up with messages from all these sources, either needing to keep all applications open at once and cluttering up my desktop, or closing some of them only to miss important information. I would love to design an application that could not only connect to these instant messaging services, but hopefully even include notifications for other important services we often use (such as piazza, or email, or news etc. 

## Objective
The simple purpose of this application is to be able to connect with many different applications and serve as a single communication point for all these other apps to plug into. This way, you can keep both receive and send of all your messages from one application. I would love for this application to be able to connect to all sorts of messaging services.

## Features to implement
A Front-end to view all the messages. The ability to log into all the messaging services independently. Hopefully able to make both a web app and mobile application (maybe even desktop application if there's enough time)
