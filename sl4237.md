# Project Proposal

Project Name: Shop Poc  

Project Link: https://github.com/KathyLau/shop-poc

## Background and Purpose
In light of recent protests and the increased participation in the Black Lives Matter Movement, we want to create an interactive map of small, black-owned and POC-owned businesses in New York City to allow users to easily find ways to shop small and support POC businesses near them.

## Tentative Plan
We plan to use data from NYC Open Data, Open Source Excel sheets shared on various websites, and the Google Maps API to plot businesses on an interactive map.

## Self Building Aspect
Users of the application can give names to unnamed small businesses (not named on NYC Open data)

## Tags and photos
Users will be able to give certain tags and attribute certain photos and comments to the businesses

## Team Members
Kathy Lau and Doria Chen
