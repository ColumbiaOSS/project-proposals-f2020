## Data Structure Visualizer

I want to build a Python library that shows common data structures visually. Arrays, Maps, Trees and Linked Lists are rendered in real time as your code runs, and can be shown while stepping through predefined breakpoints.  
  
I think this library would be especially useful to students preparing for software engineering interviews, and solving Leetcode style problems. It would be much easier to understand some problems if you could visually gauge the state of the underlying data structure.

I'm sure there are other libraries out there that provide this functionality. However, I think this project will be an engaging and interesting one to build, so I think it's a good idea to build it anyways. In addition, it will give me a good excuse to study a bit more for interviews.
