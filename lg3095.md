### Ideas
1. A web app or mobile app that aims to help pet owers better orgnize information about their pets by recording pet life and communicating with other pet owners. The users can record their pets' health conditions, medications or vaccinations to better take care of them. Also, they can record the happy time with their puppies and share the photos or videos. This app can be used as a pet diary and even a platform to find new friends for your pets.
