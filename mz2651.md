## Archery Trainer
### Description
After taking the archery PE class, I fell in love with archery. Throughout the semester, we practiced at Columbia’s indoor archery lane, where the Columbia Archery Team train. I noticed that the athletes have their practice records written on a whiteboard at the lane, including the days they come in, number of arrows shot, etc. Now as an amateur archer, I often practice shooting my recurve bow at a commercial rental indoor archery lane. However, for most of amateur archers who plan to train regularly like me, there is not a white board where we can track our training history, or a coach who keeps track for us. Usually at rental lanes, archers get a piece of target paper for each training session and can keep it for record, which is far from ideal especially in this digital era. 

I would like to make a training system that automatically logs the training sessions for individual archers and can be used by coaches to track the performance of their archery team members. The system consists of a mini camera that can be mounted on my bow, a single-board computer, and an app. The computer comes with an integrated program that processes the image frames from the training sessions, automatically extract relevant information, and synchronize everything to an mobile (web?) app:
* Date, time of training session
* Equipment specification (an archer can have multiple bow configurations or rent bows at the lane)
* Sight & stabilizer configuration 
* Range information (indoors/outdoor, range length)
* Number of arrows shot in one round or during one session
* Score history
* Visualization and statistics of training results
* Training suggestions based on performance, e.g. good/bad grouping, whether need to adjust the sight, anchor position, form analysis 


### Plan
1. Download, generate, or take photos of FITA standard target faces
2. Digital image processing techniques for feature extraction 
3. Classical / machine learning based scoring 
	1. Test on images and recorded videos 
	2. Real-time scoring
4. Interpret the results to generate text training suggestions 

### Hardware
Camera: maybe a FPV camera used on mini drones
Computers that I own and plan to try: RasPi 4, BeagleBoneBlack, Teensy

### Further work & other applications
* Multi-player tournament mode where each archer shoots in turn and the app tracks the match history
* Pose estimation from videos 
* Provide real-time aiming & form correction advice 
* A multi-camera automatic scoring system for Columbia’s archery lane
