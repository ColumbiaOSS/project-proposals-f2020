### Background
The project I am on working on is Weat, an app that's changing the restaurant industry. Weat is a startup headed by two Columbia alumni, and I'm joining the team 
as a software engineering intern. Lucas Jerez (ltj2105) and I will both be working on designing and implementing Weat's front end and back end architecture. While
specific features have not yet been shared with us, we're expecting to use skills involving database management, machine learning for user-specific content, and
app development, among other things. Both of us are excited to start this project!
