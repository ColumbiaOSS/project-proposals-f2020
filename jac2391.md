## logacat, a catalogue viewer and editor 
I work on the editorial team of a small art gallery (editing and printing books and stuff). Presently, the only way to see the exhibition catalogues is in hard copy. I think a web-based catalogue viewer would be easy to plug into the exisiting website and maybe rework into a mobile app later on. 

As a first step, I can create an interface that takes the contents of a single article (title, text, links to images, captions) then displays them on the frontend. After that I will focus on creating a suite of innovative presentation modes. 

Some ideas:
- Erasable text canvas 
- Ambient color that grades between set points in the text 
- ...
