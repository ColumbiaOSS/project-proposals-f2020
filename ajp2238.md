### Motivation
This library intends to be a tool for the use of economics educators in teaching the ever-growing complexities of macroeconomic models for trade. Often, showing the underlying math of these models is a time-intensive task, and setting up visualization for these models remains firmly in the realm of the chalkboard. By providing a library that takes care of both the calculation and the visualization of these models, I hope to provide a useful tool in automating these lessons.
### Features
In undergraduate international trade classes, there is a standard progression of models of increasing complexity - I hope to model these one by one, from basic neoclassical Ricardian trade to the more modern New Trade Theory
