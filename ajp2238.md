### Motivation
With a greater focus on online learning and academic testing than ever before, educators around the globe are becoming more reliant on technologies that ensure academic honesty despite free and constant access to the internet. As a TA, I have seen this challenge has come up multiple times when discussing how to run an exam, and rarely have the answers been efficient. The method I am looking to explore is to create a browser extension that monitors a specific browser tab as having focus, alerting an educator if a student changes focus from that tab during a period of time (ie during an exam). 
### Features
In addition to the browser extension, I want to explore ways of using other educational webtool's APIs (eg Courseworks) to integrate my tool's functionality
