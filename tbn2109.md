# Sap Au

https://github.com/thengo1/SapAu

#### Motivation

Squarespace is a website building and hosting service that allows users to build websites using drag-and-drop techniques. However, prices for Squarespace can go upwards of $46. 'Free' alternatives to Squarespace, such as WordPres, requires high technical knowledge to get started, and thus can be unappealing towards many. Other alternatives have similar drawbacks or lack certain features that make them unappealing to use.

#### Idea

Sap Au (short for Sapere aude) is an open-source alternative to proprietary website building services. The key principle of Sap Au is to allow non-technical users to deploy fully-fledged websites. The company will generate funds by selling support services and additional features that aren't in the open-source edition.

#### Objective + Manifesto

1. Minimalism

We want to provide the ability to create beautiful websites, without providing unnecessary functionalities that will clutter the user experience.

2. Never forced in and always data-secure

Sap Au will always allow users to back out  without loss of access to data.

3. Free-to-build

There will always exist a free-to-build, open source version of Sap Au for users to build websites, without paywalls. 

4. Simple

Users will be able to build websites quickly, and without the need of any technical knowledge.
