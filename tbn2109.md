# Sap Au (short for Sapere aude)

#### Motivation

Squarespace is a website building and hosting service that allows users to build websites using drag-and-drop techniques. However, prices for Squarespace can go upwards of $46. 'Free' alternatives to Squarespace, such as WordPres, requires high technical knowledge to get started, and thus can be unappealing towards many. Other alternatives have similar drawbacks or lack certain features that make them unappealing to use.

#### Idea

Sap Au is an open-source alternative to proprietary website building services. The key principle of Sap Au is to allow non-technical users to deploy fully-fledged websites. The company will generate funds by selling support services and additional features that aren't in the open-source edition.

#### Objective + Manifesto

1. Minimalism
We want to provide the ability to create beautiful websites, without providing unncessary functionalities that will clutter the user experience.

2. Never forced in and always data-secure
Sap Au will always allow users to back out  without loss of access to data.

3. Free-to-build
There will always exist a free-to-build, open source version of Sap Au for users to build websites, without paywalls. 

4. Simple
Users will be able to build websites quickly, and without the need of any technical knowledge.
