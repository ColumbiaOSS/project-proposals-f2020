Bbook is a static single page website builder that's designed to create a page that's similar to a (up-and-down) book.

#### Objective + Manifesto

1. Minimalism

We want to provide the ability to create beautiful websites, without providing unnecessary functionalities that will clutter the user experience.

2. Never forced in and always data-secure

We will always allow users to back out anytime, without loss of access to data.

3. Free-to-build

There will always exist a free-to-build, open source version of Bbook for users to build websites, without paywalls. 

4. Simple

Users will be able to build websites quickly, and without the need of any technical knowledge.
