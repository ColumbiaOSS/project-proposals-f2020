### Background

MWB (maintenance of well being) is a program dedicated to equipping individuals with the science and technology of well-being primarily through meditation. Its founder, Dr. Nasar Shahid, a Pain Medicine Specialist in Teaneck, NJ founded this program when he realized that there exists 5 complex factors that stand in the way of an individual's journey to well-being; 

1. Lack of dedicated time on the part of an individual
2. Absence of a structured program supervised by a physician
3. Lack of motivation/inspiration
4. Lack of a scientific approach to information
5. A partial understanding of well-being

MWB works to address these five issues through group sessions, one-on-one counseling with individuals seeking to improve their well-being, and guided meditation. 

MWB's website is the main tool that participants will use to create an account so that they can book sessions with Dr.Shahid, keep track of their diet/sleep schedule, and watch instructional meditation videos and provide feedback.
