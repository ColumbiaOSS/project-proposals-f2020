### Background
With the rise of the competitive video gaming industry and large investments from game developers such as Valve and Riot Games in the "first person shooter"
genre, many aspiring gamers use third party tools to train their reaction time and aiming ability. Since professional FPS gamers have recently started using 
and advertising these tools, many game devs have rushed to create aim training tools (i.e. Kovaak, AimLab).

### Project
Create a video game aim trainer housed in a web app.

### Tech Stack
Currently looking into game dev technologies, hoping to use JavaScript or Python to create the web app.
